🚀 Final Bootcamp Project Completed!

I developed an interactive **Market Basket Analysis app for retail** as part of my *Data Science & Machine Learning* training at 4Geeks Academy.

📌 The app enables:
- Analyzing real transaction data to detect frequent purchase patterns
- Generating **personalized recommendations and real product bundles**
- Translating association rules into **prioritized business actions**
- Exporting a strategic action plan to increase average ticket size
- 💰 Driving revenue growth through data-driven decisions
- 📦 Optimizing inventory turnover and reducing operational costs by identifying dependent or low-rotation products

👩‍💻 Tools: Python · Streamlit · Apriori · mlxtend · Data Visualization · Interpretable Machine Learning

All packaged into a professional Streamlit app with navigation, interactive visuals, and business focus.

## 💬 Personal Pitch (for interviews or "about me" section)

> “This project allowed me to apply association rule mining with a real business focus.  
> I didn’t stop at the analysis — I built an interactive app where a business user can explore buying patterns, discover cross-sell opportunities, and walk away with a prioritized action plan.  
> I built it using Python, Streamlit, and mlxtend, leveraging the Apriori algorithm as an interpretable Machine Learning technique.  
> What I enjoyed most was connecting data science and strategy — not just to drive revenue, but also to reduce costs through smarter inventory decisions.”
